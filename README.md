Solving the Poisson equation with different charge densities

Default branch that solves the system for a cubic box with zero voltage boundary conditions, 
and a punctual charge density (an electron in the middle of the box).

The charge of electron is assumed as e = -1. The lenght of the box is 1. The boundary conditions
are that the box has potential equal to zero.

The program is efficient while n is less than 21.
